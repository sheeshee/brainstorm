# An Idea Management System

# Overview

**Rooster Thought** (working title) is an Idea Management System (IMS) meant to facilitate the process of an individual or team cataloguing ideas and transforming them into products or projects.

It sits on the following principals:

* All ideas are worth cataloguing.
* The correct process will surface the most valuable ideas.
* It is not trivial to produce a valuable idea, but it is possible to recognise an existing idea as valuable.
* The average judgement of many individuals will be close to the truth.

A valuable IMS is one that implements a process that surfaces the most valuable ideas. By allowing group members to "vote" for ideas, the "wisdom of the crowd" will ensure that the most interesting ideas come forward.

Groups will rely on the IMS to guide their ideation process, so it must suggest a framework that they can effortlessly adopt and adapt.

# Definitions

**Call to Innovate** or **Challenge**: _Members of a group respond to a prompt/challenge/problem statement by generating as many ideas as possible in a limited time span._

# Scenarios

## Classic Brainstorm with Regular Follow Up

Blue is a member of the leadership team at Sunny City Primary and Secondary School. They and other executives are meeting over video conference to brainstorm ideas for projects to improve their school's processes.

They use the online web app Live Whiteboard where they will list issues, possible improvements, new technologies/concepts on digital post-its during a time-limited, silent brainstorming session. Afterwords, they iterate through the post-its, and each participant takes 30 seconds to explain their post-it. Finally, the group uses a dot-voting approach to identify which ideas they found most interesting as a collective.

The top 3 ideas are assigned to 3 different volunteers who will dig into them further and present their findings in next week's session. Each session will have the volunteer make a recommendation of whether the idea needs further exploration, if it should be archived or if it is ready to be formulated into a formal project.

## Good Ideation, Poor Convergence

Yellow is part of the R&D team at The Good Utilities Company. They and their team pitch research projects to the rest of the business and receive funding for a project when a funding manager sees value in it.

Usually Yellow's team meets in the office, spends some time writing down ideas (sometimes in response to a prompt) then presenting them to each other and grouping them together (and sometimes into predefined categories). The team have the intern write these all up in Excel. It is not clear to the team however which of their ideas are the most valuable, so when their manager asks which ones should be written up into proposals, the team is at a loss.

This time however, Yellow recently heard about Rooster Thought as a great facilitator for brainstorming sessions. They ask the team if they would be willing to give it a go and the team, desperate for an improvement in their process accepts. Yellow creates a "call to innovate" on the platform and shares a link in the team's Slack/MSTeam channel. The members all join on their individual laptops and Yellow sets a 20 minute timer. As each team member submits an idea, it shows up as a digital post-it on all their machines. At the end, similar ideas are automatically grouped by the platform's AI system.

The team goes through the ideas and assess each according to some clever criteria (TBD). At the end of the session, the ideas are ranked and the team chooses which ones to develop further.

## Other scenarios:

* Market Benchmarking: catalogue and discuss what competitors are doing
* Next Book Idea: an individual keeps a log of ideas for their next book or for a book they are working on
* Process optimisation: the facilitator has a diagram explaining a process, the team adds post-its on to the diagram with comments, then votes about which are the most interesting
* Never Brainstormed Before: Uni students want to build a robot for a competition and have no idea how to organise their ideas.
* Asynchronous Ideation: a team is working on a subject and wants a place to keep ideas, when someone adds a new one, the team gets notified.
